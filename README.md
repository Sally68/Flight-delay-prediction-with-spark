# Flight-delay-prediction-with-spark

We build a classification model to predicts airline delay from historial flight data. This dataset is 5 GB and contains 52 million flight records. Processing of such a large data set requires use of a Spark cluster.

This notebook is will run as an application for the Apache Spark service on Bluemix.

This notebook will operate on the data set stored in the Swift (Bluemix Object Storage) file system.
